# Magical-Waifus-Academy-PS4
A port/patch to make the game **Magical Waifus Academy** (Steam Version) playable on the PS4.

**Based on version 1.1 of the game** (I know, I know, the latest version is 1.2.3s (as of creation of this repo), but in all honesty, when I started the project, the latest version was v1.1 and the project went on standby for a few months and I really didn't feel to start "from scratch" again, so... Maybe I'll update it in the future...)
